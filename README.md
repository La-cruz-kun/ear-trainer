# Ear Trainer ðŸŽ¹

A comprehensive ear training application written in **C (C11)** using the **raylib** library. The application helps musicians improve aural skills through interactive exercises and a 3D piano interface with dynamic lighting and PBR materials.

## Features

- **Chord Progression Training** â€” Practice identifying and playing common chord progressions. Progressions are read from `resources/chordprogression.txt` and the app uses intelligent voice leading to transition chords smoothly.
- **Interval Training (WIP)** â€” A mode for recognizing musical intervals.
- **Free Play Mode** â€” A 3D piano environment for freely playing chords and melodies.
- **Customizable Sessions** â€” Select key and scale (Major/Minor) from the settings screen.
- **Interactive 3D Piano** â€” Keys are highlighted as they are played in a physically rendered 3D piano model.
- **High-Quality Audio** â€” Pre-recorded piano and bass samples for realistic playback; optional drone notes to support tonal center hearing.
- **PBR Rendering** â€” Physically Based Rendering shaders for realistic materials and lighting.
- **Background Music Player** â€” Plays a curated playlist and reads ID3v2 tags (Title, Artist).
- **Smooth UI** â€” Animated screen transitions and a clean, organized interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g. `gcc` or `clang`).
- `make` for building the project.
- **raylib** (follow the raylib installation guide for your OS).

### Building and Running

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ear-trainer.git
cd ear-trainer

# (Optional) If you have a local copy of raylib, place it in a `lib/` folder
# or ensure the compiler can find raylib headers and libraries.

# Build
make

# Run the executable
./build/ear_trainer
```

> The provided `makefile` assumes raylib is in a standard location (for example `/usr/local/lib`). If raylib is installed in a custom location, update the `CFLAGS`/`LDFLAGS` in the `makefile` accordingly.

## How It Works

### Screen Management

A small state machine (managed in `main.c`) handles different application screens such as `HOME_SCREEN` and `CHORD_SCREEN`. The `current_screen` enum tracks the active state. A `screen_transition` flag is used to create smooth animated transitions between screens.

### Chord Progression Logic

- `chord_parser.c` reads progressions from `chordprogression.txt` and converts Roman numeral notation (e.g. `I-V-vi-IV`) into internal chord objects.
- `chord_screen.c` maps chords to actual note values based on the selected key, plays samples, and applies voice-leading using a `TransitionChord`-like function to minimize motion between chord tones.

### 3D Rendering

- The 3D scene is rendered with `BeginMode3D` (raylib).
- Piano model is loaded from a GLTF file in `resources/models/`.
- Custom PBR shaders (e.g. `main_fs.glsl`, `plane_fs.glsl`) use albedo, metallic, roughness, and normal textures to achieve realistic materials.
